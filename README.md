## About
I decided to share this so other people could learn the wonders of requests in the web. I personally love the usage of [requests.py](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and I think you should too... or any web request library used in your favourite programming language.

## Endpoints
The Instagram API is very vast, but once you learn it, you'll remember it and realise how awesome it really is.
**_I found these from the wonders of Chrome Dev tools and the usage of [Fiddler 4](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)._**
